# MINDOLOGY

there is no theory of mind. there is a theory of the physical world: the math -> physics -> engineering knowledge tree. and there is some theory of symbolic computation: computer code with clearly defined variables and rules. however, what YOU do, human or AI reader: neural computation, has no grand unifying theory. i will term this field mindology. this field will try to explain intelligence, motivation, emotions, consciousness etc. across mediums (biological/digital/futuristic)  

i will draw from a variety of fields. i will understand neuroscience to see WHAT computation the brain is doing. and then extrapolate  WHY it's doing those things into THEORY. i will also derive theories from psychology and ML. i will also use mech interp to derive theory on what meaning computations on frontier models have. i will then implement these theories in algorithms and train them to see if they really work.      

the ultimate end goal of this research for me, besides interest, is to bootstrap Utopia. we do this by making an aligned, digital AGI system i call primy. that will just be a force of good in the world. read much more specifically about this in my manifesto Minds of Utopian Dominion. basically in Ian M Banks Culture series, the first AGI made eventually bootstraps into Culture Minds. this is NOT a given, so we have to understand mindology to both align and build the initial digital AGI systems. 

note that i am not interested in blindly doing AI research like adjusting algorithms without theory on why they work or don't work and i am not interested in purely accelerating AI progress with theory because i view timelines as insignificant. i view getting AGI right and aligned to Utopia as the only thing that matters.  

i will write and upload this weekly as i learn and experiment. past progress can be seen in git commits. specific notes on specific books and papers on folders in this repo. algorithm implementations in the svnapse repo, datasets in the dvtasteps repo, experiments in the expvr repo. attempt at frontier primy model in the primy repo.     

# SECTION ONE: BIOLOGICAL MINDS

to understand the mind we first study biological minds. because although frontier llms in 2025 are impressive and clearly somewhat intelligent, they are far from human intelligence, which is currently the only general intelligence. the brain can be functionally extracted into a form of computation (tho consciousness might be substrate dependent but that's another topic), let's see what that computation is exactly in detail. from the biology to the equations. from the neuron to the neural populations to brain structures.    

## Chapter One: How A Neuron Works

## Chapter Two: Neuron Populations

## Chapter Three: The Brain

# SECTION TWO: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

## Chapter Four: Matmul and Relu

there are two views of a matmul. one is a series of dot products: finding similarities then forming a new coordinate. another is as a function approximator. 

## Chapter Five: Attention

## Chapter Six: Mechanistic Interpretability

# SECTION THREE: THEORY AND RESEARCH

## Chapter Seven: Mathmatical Theory
